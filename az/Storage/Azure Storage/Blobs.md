Blob types:
	1. Block (storing text and binary data; default)
	2. Append (logs)
	3. Page (VM OS and data disks; up to 8 TB in size)


### Blob Storage Costs

Blob storage costs are tiered based on rate of access:
	1. Hot (frequent acces; default)
	2. Cool (stored 30+ days with infrequent access)
	3. Archive (stored 180+ days with seldom access)
		- *It may take up to (**15**) hours to upgrade archive to cool tier for ready access.*
*==Blobs will automatically **downgrade** tiers if conditions are met to save costs==*
